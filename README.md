# Cgmn

A c guess my number program. 

## About

This is my first C project on github, I will admit, I am a C noob, so please put issues if you find any, and please make them simple for me :)

## Installing

I see no need for automake and autoconf, so the install directions are as follows: `make`, `make install`.
To clean up binaries and stale .o's use `make clean`.
